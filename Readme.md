<h1>The "pflanzi" project</h1>

<img src="https://hosac.github.io/pflanzi/images/pic01.jpg" height="200" title="Pflanzi picture" style="float:left">
Please read the leaflet with the project overview on https://hosac.github.io/pflanzi

<h2>Idea</h2>

There are so many audio speakers in the market but most of them are restricted/limited in functionality or not open to modify them. In nearly all appartments and rooms are plants or artificial plants. Why not combining both?<br>
(The project name is a modification of the german word for plant)

<h2>Mechanical, 3D-printed parts</h2>

The best way to provide files, instructions and details for 3D-printing is to use dedicated platforms. Please find "pflanzi" on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4429067).

<h2>Shopping list / Assembly instructions</h2>

[This overview](ShoppingAssembly.md) contains all important information which parts are used and a proposal where to buy them.

<h2>Software</h2>

Options are available for standard and experienced users in the [installation instructions](Software.md).

<h2>Still open</h2>

- It is possible to mount an environmental [Adafruit Breakout BME680 sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660) on the back of the insert and is the reason for the cut-outs on the rear side of the pot. Building a local website, pushing the data to cloud or home automation system could be an interesting application.
- Waveshares Audio-HAT comes with two microphones onboard. Speech/voice control or sound for the video would be a great feature.
